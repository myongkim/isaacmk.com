title: My Experience at Bloc
---

As I am a new to the developer world. I do not know much of the developing. However, as I am in the program for about 5 months, I believe there are good and bad for the Bloc program. Or I will say pros and cons for the online program in general. 

As I wanted to learn to code from the scratch, I have a few choices. One is the offline class and the other will be an online class. As I am still working, and I wanted to be in transition to the software development world, I had to make a choice between quitting a job versus learning from online. 

I chose to stay at work and make some time to study at my own paced. The program that I am in is typically 6 months course, however, I am intending to finish it on a one-year basis. Bloc allows me to take as many times as I needed and the curriculum seems to be ok (which I have too little knowledge for the software engineering cannot determine if this is good or not). 

I like my mentor and he is trying to help me through the course, although sometimes there is a miscommunication between us regards to the issues but general speaking he is awesome. Once I am done, I will fly out and buy him a drink or something. 

At the same time, it is an online course, it makes me hard for me to ask a question when I have a question right away. If I was in the classroom setting, I can ask my classmates and teachers right away to learn as fast as it can be. That is why it seems to me, it makes little more frustration than taking regular classes. 

Even though I do have the slack account and others to ask some questions, as starting to learning a new program, I don't know what I don't know. I guess that is the most challenging part of the curriculum. 

Once I know what I don't know, actually I can find out from the stackflow or other websites.

If I were to rate Bloc, 
for the people have a job and does not want to quit it, it should be the best fit. I will give them 4.5 stars out of 5

If I were to quit the job or I can commit 100% of the time, I will choose offline class so I will give 2 stars out of 5 for it.

At the end of the day, it all depends on the people.
