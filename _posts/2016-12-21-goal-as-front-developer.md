title: Goal as a Frontend developer
---

The reason I wanted to be a frontend developer is simple. As I was in the finance industry for about 8 years, I found that in the near future we will be living in the world where everything should be shifted. I know for fact that how finance industry will be shifting. I wanted to be the part of the change and make the different of the world. As a frontend or backend developer, it will give me a choice where I can build an application that is fully automated investment strategies. Not only that it will ultimately allow us to create a new type of investment which allows optimal rate of return base on the machine learning. It is a long shot that I have to go on, however, step by step, I wanted to achieve the goal that I have. 

It excites me to see the future, and where the technology will take us. Not only that I do like something is challenging. As I am doing the same thing over and over again, it makes a stall and I wanted to be little more creative. What frontend or other developers that I see makes my heart beat pounds little more. I do not know that I will like the career being frontend or backend even software developer. I know one thing is that I can always challenge myself by being in this type of field. If this is not the field that I needed to be in, then I can always have a back up to coming back to the financial field. 

Young, I can't say up to what age is young. One thing I realize is that if I do not have a dream or pursue the future, then I am old. I wanted to stay young as much as I can.
