title: The biggest challenge you've faced when learning to develop
---

The most challenging part of being a developer or learning is commitment. 
I think it takes serious discipline you to finish the task. Sometimes, you do not want to study at all. Also, life happens as you are living your life.

As for my experience, past six months, I went to Korea for two times, new york for once (I am living in Los Angeles), got married and work has to be done. It is just named few things that have to happen last six months. Your social life should be constrained to make everything possible. 

The second thing that I can think is that I do not know what I don't know. If I know clearly what I need to study, it should be easy to get concentrated, but the technology changes daily and your determination also changes daily as well. It seems to like shooting at the moving target. Knowing what you wanted to accomplish will make easier to learn what you wanted to learn. 

The third point would know where to get a help. As Bloc has a good program where you have a mentorship along the way. So whenever you are stuck, then you can ask the questions. I think if they have better orientation class, it will be easier for learners to know what is to be expected and more.
